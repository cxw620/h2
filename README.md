More information about this crate can be found in the [crate documentation][dox].

## Features

* Client and server HTTP/2 implementation.
* Implements the full HTTP/2 specification.
* Passes [h2spec](https://github.com/summerwind/h2spec).
* Focus on performance and correctness.
* Built on [Tokio](https://tokio.rs).

## Non goals

This crate is intended to only be an implementation of the HTTP/2
specification. It does not handle:

* Managing TCP connections
* HTTP 1.0 upgrade
* TLS
* Any feature not described by the HTTP/2 specification.

This crate is now used by [hyper](https://github.com/hyperium/hyper), which will provide all of these features.

## Usage

To use `miku-h2`, first add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
miku-h2 = "0.4"
```

Next, add this to your crate:

```rust
extern crate miku_h2;

use miku_h2::server::Connection;

fn main() {
    // ...
}
```

## FAQ

**How does h2 compare to [solicit] or [rust-http2]?**

The h2 library has implemented more of the details of the HTTP/2 specification
than any other Rust library. It also passes the [h2spec] set of tests. The h2
library is rapidly approaching "production ready" quality.

Besides the above, Solicit is built on blocking I/O and does not appear to be
actively maintained.

**Is this an embedded Java SQL database engine?**

[No](https://www.h2database.com).

## Statement and thanks

This crate is a fork of [h2](https://github.com/hyperium/h2) and modified
to support HTTP2 fingerprinting impersonation, being inspired by
[0x676e67/http2](https://github.com/0x676e67/http2).
